## Goal

A game of cat and mouse! Guide the mouse with your cursor to the cheese without running into any pesky cats or falling off the edge of the platforms. How fast can you make it through the game?

## Controls

Click on the mouse character (no need to hold the button down), and he will follow your cursor. The farther you move the cursor away, the faster he will try to catch up! 

## Jam Info

The game and all art assets were made from scratch in Unity exclusively for the '8 Bits To Infinity' Mouse Jam 2.

The jam's theme was 'chase', and the 'focus' was 'mouse only'. "Doki Doki Mouse" fits into the theme/focus by only using the mouse for the input and is a "game of cat and mouse" (i.e., it involves chasing :)).

Diversifiers: "By the Hand" (All art was hand drawn, minus the tileset, which is pixel art), Quick Run, One Button.

## Game Info

All character art was drawn by hand using Adobe Fresco, except the tilemap which was created using Aseprite.

The game was made using the Unity game engine.

The song used is by "SandraLilly" and was made before the jam:
